\subsection{ Response time analysis for the CAN bus messages}

\section{System model}
%• System model derivation, design space exploration and controller
%parameter design

\section{Design decision}
%• Your design decision and justification.

\section{Results}
%• Results
Firstly: Response time analysis\\
Secondly: Control system input and output









%• 3 processors:
%• PU1: Fixed Priority Preemptive (FPP)
%• PU2: Fixed Priority Preemptive (FPP)
%• PU3: CompSOC platform using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) with a clock
%frequency running @ 100 MHz
%− Partition slots: 245904 clock cycles: 2.45904 ms
%− CoMik slots: 4096 clock cycles: 40.96 us
%− TDM period: 1000000 clock cycles: 10 ms
%− 4 Partition slots, 4 CoMik slots
%• Multiple tasks running on each processor
%• PU1: T1, T2, T3, Ts
%• PU2: T5, T6, T7, T8
%• PU3: S1 (unassigned), S2 (T4), S3 (Tca), S4 (unassigned)
%• Communication task in all processors has a WCETcom = 0.05 ms
%• Communication bus : CAN
%• Transmission of each message over the CAN bus takes 1 ms

%
%• Design the controller and its implementation such that
%1. The real-time tasks meet their deadlines and end-to-end delay
%requirements. For this assign the priorities in each processor
%and the CAN bus to meet the requirements. You may use the
%response time analysis MATLAB scripts provided with the
%assignment.
%2. Input signal 𝐕𝐕 should be designed such that the motor position
%(shatft angle) is 𝜽𝜽 = 𝟑𝟑. 𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏 rad for a maximum available input
%signal is 1 V, and maximum settling time of 400 ms
%3. A design space exploration of system poles which satisfy the
%requirements (input signal, settling time) should be done.
%4. Hint: use the sampled-data model used in the lectures (derive
%the augmented system). Be careful during discretization.
